This document describes the device tree bindings associated with the
keystone network driver support.

reg:		the register start address and the size that will be
		used by the driver. The second index is for the efuse
		mac address
tx-channel:	the packet dma channel name associated with tx
tx-queue-depth: the number of descriptors to be used
rx-channel:	the packet dma channel name associated with rx
rx-queue-depth: there can be at present a maximum of 4 queues per packet
		dma channel. We can specify the number of descriptors for
		each queue
rx-buffer-size: For each receive queue, we can specify a buffer size.
efuse-mac:	If this is 1, then the mac address is obtained from the
		device efuse mac address register
local-mac-address:the driver is designed to use the of_get_mac_address api
		  only if efuse-mac is 0. When efuse-mac is 0, the mac address
		  is obtained from local-mac-address.

The keystone network device can open other modules such as cpsw or pa.

Below we provide an example.

netcp: netcp@2090000 {
			reg = <0x2090000 0xf00
				0x2620110 0x8>;
			compatible = "ti,keystone-netcp";

			tx-channel = "nettx";
			tx-queue-depth = <128>;

			rx-channel = "netrx";
			rx-queue-depth = < 128 128 0 0>;
			rx-buffer-size = <1500 4096 0 0>;

			efuse-mac = <1>;
			local-mac-address = [00 18 31 7e 3e 6e];

			pa: pa@2000000 {
				label = "keystone-pa";
			};
		};
