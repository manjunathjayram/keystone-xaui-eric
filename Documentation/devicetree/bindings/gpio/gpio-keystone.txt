Keystone GPIO controller bindings

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "ti,keystone-gpio"
- reg : Address and length of the register set for the device. For
	first bank, 2 reg entries required. At index 0 specify base
	of common registers at the beginning of gpio address space that
	includes BINTEN. This should have a size 0x10. At second index
	specify base address of bank0 & 1. For subsequent bank, only
	one reg entry should be specified and should be poiting to
	base of the bank.
- gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
- #gpio-cells : Should be 2.  First cell specify the pin number and
	second is optional parameter (unused).
- clocks: phandle to clock node
- clock-names: name of the input clock
- interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells: Should be 2. The first cell is the GPIO number.
  The second cell bits[3:0] is used to specify trigger type:
	1 = low-to-high edge triggered.
	2 = high-to-low edge triggered.

Note: Each GPIO port should have an alias correctly numbered in "aliases"
node.

Examples:

aliases {
        gpio0 = &gpio0;
        gpio1 = &gpio1;
        gpio2 = &gpio2;
        gpio3 = &gpio3;
        gpio4 = &gpio4;
};

gpio0: gpio@2320000 {
	compatible = "ti,keystone-gpio";
	reg = <0x02320000 0x10
		0x02320010 0x28>;
	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	clocks = <&clkgpio>;
	clock-names = "gpio";
};

To use gpio pins in the driver, include the phandle to the gpio device bindings
in the specific driver device bindings.

Example:

following commands in the DT bindings of the device refers to gpio0, pin 20:-

	test-gpios = <&gpio0 20 0x2>;

Third argument (0x2) is the flag and is currently not used. Driver typically use
the API of_get_named_gpio_flags() to refers to the specific gpio pin and use GPIO
libraries to configure the pin.

To use the gpio pin as an interrupt line, set the interrupt-parent to
gpio driver device node that is associated with the gpio pin and include a
interrupts property in the driver's device bindings to specify the irq number and
flag as

	interrupts = <20 0x2>
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;

where gpio pin 20 is configured as interrupt line and flag is set to high to low
edge triggered. gpio0 node is the interrupt-parent.
