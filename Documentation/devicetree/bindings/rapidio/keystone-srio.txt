This document describes the device tree bindings associated with the KeyStone
Serial RapidIO driver support.

Required properties
-------------------

#address-cells
#size-cells:      Should be '1' if the device has sub-nodes with 'reg' property.
reg:              Address and length of the register set for the SRIO subsystem on
                  the SOC. There are three ranges of registers:
		   - RapidIO registers
		   - boot configuration registers (for JTAGID and K1 SerDes setup)
		   - SerDes configuration registers
clocks:           Clock IDs array as required by the controller.
clock-names:      Names of clocks corresponding to IDs in the clock property.
compatible:       Should be "ti,keystone-rapidio".
interrupts:       The two IRQ definitions for:
		   - RIO special interrupts (doorbell, error, port-write in, ...)
                   - LSU completion.

Optional properties
-------------------

dma-coherent:     Indicate if DirectIO operations support hw cache-coherency.
		  On KeyStone platforms it is recommended to set this property
		  when running on ARM cores.
keystone2-serdes: Indicate that the driver needs to use KeyStone 2 SerDes
		  initialization. If not specified, it will KeyStone 1
		  initialization instead.
baudrate:         This the lane baudrate configuration number (from 0 to 3).
		  If not specified the baudrate configuration 0 will be used
                  (1.25Gbps).
path_mode:        This is the SerDes lane to port configuration number (from 0 to 4).
		  If not specified the mode 0 will be used (4 ports in 1x).
port-register-timeout:
		  This is the delay in seconds for waiting the port registration at
                  startup. if not specified a default 30 second value will be used.
ports:            This is the bitfield of RapidIO port(s) to probe at startup.
		  If not specified, no port will be used.
dev-id-size:      RapidIO common transport system size:
                   0 - Small size, 8-bit deviceID fields, 256 devices.
                   1 - Large size, 16-bit deviceID fields, 65536 devices.
		  If not specifed 0 (8-bit) value will be used.
lsu:              Index of the two LSUs that will be used for DirectIO transfers and
		  maintenance requests. If not specified LSU 0 will be used for both
		  (LSUs can be shared).
tx_channel:       This is the packet DMA channel name associated with MP transmit.
                  If not specified the "riotx" name will be used.
tx_queue_depth:   Number of descriptors for the transmit queue. Default is 128
                  descriptors.
num-mboxes:       Number of receive mailboxes used for MP. If not specified, only one
		  mailbox will be used.

Sub-nodes
---------
Each mailbox (according to num-mboxes) must be added as subnodes "mbox-%d" with %d the
mailbox number (from 0 to n).
This sub-node has the following properties:

rx_channel:       The packet DMA channel associated to this receive mailbox.
rx_queue_depth:   There can be at present a maximum of 4 queues per packet DMA channel.
		  We can specify the number of descriptors for each queue.
rx-buffer-size:   For each receive queue, we can specify the buffer size.
stream_id:        If specified, the mailbox will be mapped to the indicated stream ID
		  and packet type 9 will be used instead of packet type 11.
