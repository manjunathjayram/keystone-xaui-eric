Davinci SPI controller device bindings

Required properties:
- #address-cells: number of cells required to define a chip select
	address on the SPI bus. Should be set to 1.
- #size-cells: should be zero.
- compatible:
	- "ti,davinci-spi-v1" for SPI version 1.0
	- "ti,davinci-spi-v2" for SPI version 2.0
- reg: Offset and length of SPI controller register space
- ti,davinci-spi-num-cs: Number of chip selects. This includes
	internal as well as GPIO chip selects.
- ti,davinci-spi-intr-line: interrupt line used to connect the SPI
	IP to the interrupt controller withn the SoC. Possible values
	are 0 and 1. Manual says one of the two possible interrupt
	lines can be tied to the interrupt controller. Set this
	based on a specifc SoC configuration.
- interrupts: interrupt number offset at the irq parent
- clocks: spi clk phandle

Optional:
- cs-gpios: gpio chip selects
	For example to have 3 internal CS and 2 GPIO CS, user could define
	cs-gpios = <0>, <0>, <0>, <&gpio1 30 0>, <&gpio1 31 0>;
	where first three are internal CS and last two are GPIO CS.

Example of a NOR flash slave device (n25q032) connected to DaVinci
SPI controller device over the SPI bus.

spi0:spi@20BF0000 {
	#address-cells			= <1>;
	#size-cells			= <0>;
	compatible			= "ti,davinci-spi-v1";
	reg				= <0x20BF0000 0x1000>;
	ti,davinci-spi-num-cs		= <4>;
	ti,davinci-spi-intr-line	= <0>;
	interrupts			= <338>;
	clocks				= <&clkspi>;

	flash: n25q032@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "st,m25p32";
		spi-max-frequency = <25000000>;
		reg = <0>;

		partition@0 {
			label = "u-boot-spl";
			reg = <0x0 0x80000>;
			read-only;
		};

		partition@1 {
			label = "test";
			reg = <0x80000 0x380000>;
		};
	};
};

SPI slave nodes must be children of the SPI master node and can
contain the following properties. Not all SPI Peripherals from
Texas Instruments support this. Please check SPI peripheral UG
for a device before using these.

- ti,davinci-spi-wdelay : delay between transmissions.
- ti,davinci-spi-odd-parity : odd partity enabled
   OR
- ti,davinci-spi-even-parity : even parity enabled
- ti,davinci-spi-io-type: io type (check platform_data/spi-davinci.h)
- ti,davinci-spi-disable-timer: disable CS timer (SPIFMTn)
- ti,davinci-spi-c2t-delay: c2t delay
- ti,davinci-spi-t2c-delay: t2c delay
- ti,davinci-spi-t2e-delay: t2e delay
- ti,davinci-spi-c2e-delay: c2e delay
